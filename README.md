## Using

For continuously generate the paper as the source file is edited, run:
- `./serve.sh <paper_source_filename>`

This will open the paper in the browser, and will continuously regenerate it as the source changes.

### Papers using pandoc

Prerequisite:
- install `pandoc`; follow steps at [official documentation](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)

To generate the output file once:
- run `make -f wg21/Makefile <paper_name>.html
  - the paper with source at `<paper_name>.md` will be generated at `generated/<paper_name>.html`

### Papers using bikeshed

Prerequisite:
- install `pipx`; follow steps at [official documentation](https://pipx.pypa.io/latest/installation/#installing-pipx)

To generate the output file once:
- run `pipx run bikeshed spec <bikeshed_filename>`

To have live edits on the page:
- run `pipx run bikeshed serve <bikeshed_filename>`
- open [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) and open the corresponding .html file
- making changes to the source file will automatically regenerate the content; browser needs to be refreshed
