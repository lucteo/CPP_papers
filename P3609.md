# Abstract # {- .unlisted}

Error reporting is often considered a weak point of C++; this is especially true in code that is heavily templated.
There are times when the actual source of the error is not properly captured in the error messages.
There are other cases where the error messages are so long that, even if the source of the error is properly captured, it gets hidden in the noise.
Also, different compilers approach error reporting differently; library authors who try to improve error reporting on one compiler often make the errors hard to interpret on other compilers.

This paper proposes a mechanism by which library authors can control error reporting for some misuses of their library.
